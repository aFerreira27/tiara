# Blueprint for Spec Sheet PDF Generator

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a PDF spec sheet generator for products, based on provided product data. The generator will use the `pdfmake` library to create a PDF document with a layout similar to the provided image example, including sections for standard features, specifications, and product compliance.

## Project Outline

*   **Initial Version:** Implement basic PDF generation with product name and SKU.
*   **Current Version:** Integrate `pdfmake` and set up font embedding. Start structuring the document content based on the provided image.
*   **Future Versions:** Add sections for standard features, specifications, and product compliance. Include product images and technical drawings. Refine styling and layout to match the example image as closely as possible.

## Plan for Current Change

1.  Install `pdfmake` as a project dependency.
2.  Create a function `generateSpecSheetPDF` that takes formatted product data and returns a `pdfmake` document definition.
3.  Modify the existing `generateSpecSheet` (or a new function if the user intends to keep both) to use the `generateSpecSheetPDF` function.
4.  Ensure fonts are correctly embedded and referenced in the `pdfmake` document definition.
5.  Begin structuring the `docDefinition` in `generateSpecSheetPDF` to include basic product information (name, SKU) and placeholders for future sections (Standard Features, Specifications, Product Compliance) based on the provided image.

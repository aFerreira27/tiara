### Overview

This project is a Next.js application integrated with Firebase. The AI assistant is responsible for managing the project, including code modifications, dependency management, error detection and remediation, and visual design.

### Project Outline

*   **Initial Version:** Basic Next.js application with Firebase integration.
*   **Current Version:** Includes a product detail page with tag display and a popover component.

### Plan for Current Change: Move Popover

**Goal:** Move the popover component to appear above the name and email fields on the user profile page.

**Steps:**

1.  Read the content of the file containing the popover component.
2.  Modify the style of the popover to position it above the name and email fields.
3.  Write the modified content back to the file.
4.  Run lint checks and monitor the dev server for errors.
5.  Check the preview to ensure the popover is correctly positioned.
